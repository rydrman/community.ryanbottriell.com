                    <p>Marco Brito is in his last year of Interactive Multimedia and Design at Carleton University. His favourite memory of Birdsfoot was riding the tractor from one end to the other</p>

                    <div class="aboutus-img" id="ryan"></div>
                    <p>Ryan Bottriell is an Interactive Multimedia and Design Student at Carelton University. He has a strange but wonderful love for buses, and his favourtie memory of Birdsfoot was meeting their ducklings.</p>

                <div class="us-profile">
                    <div class="aboutus-img" id="zara"></div>
                    <p>Zara is a fourth year student in the Interactive Multimedia and Design program at Carleton University. Outside of school she likes to be outside, riding bikes or swimming in a (heated) pool, or inside snuggled up under a blanket watching movies and playing "Don't Starve". She also realized while writing this that it sounds a lot like a dating profile. Awkward.</p>

                    <div class="aboutus-img" id="kerra"></div>
                    <p> Kerra is in her fourth year of her Journalism degree at Carleton. Her favourite memory of Birdsfoot was being the only member of the group who managed to avoid stepping in cow poop as well as not being bitten by any mosquitos, therefore asserting her God-like powers.</p>

                <div class="us-profile">
                    <div class="aboutus-img" id="rachel"></div>
                    <p>Rachel is currently attempting her fourth-year as a journalism major at Carleton University. While at Birdsfoot, Rachel had a terrible experience with stinging nettles. A member taught her to identify the remedy, jewelweed, and now she isn't nearly as scared of nettles. When not in her natural habitat (any functioning newsroom), at work, or in class, Rachel can be found getting yet another cup of coffee or compulsively checking her phone for the latest scoop.</p>
