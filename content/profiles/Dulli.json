At a young age she discovered her love for cows and farm life in general and made the decision then that she would one day live on a farm.</p><p>Tengeler first came to Birdsfoot in 1990 as an intern for six months and returned in 1991 to marry Steve Molnar. They began the difficult task of building their home, spending up to 16 hours a day working on it.</p><p>Tengeler runs the organic farming business at Birdsfoot. She is proud of the farm\"s products.</p><p>\"Ours are really fresh, we just pick them as we need them or they have been just picked,\" she says. \"All our vegetables are organic, you know what\"s in them and on them. I don\"t even want to eat lettuce unless it comes in fresh . We\"re food snobs.\"</p><p>Her vegetables are sold at farmers markets, and with the help of programs like CSA (community supported agriculture) where people pay a fee for a box of fresh crate of vegetables every week, Tengeler supplies about 45 community members with whatever produce they have.</p><p>\"The say you need about 80-200 customers to live off it,\" says Tengeler. \"But since we have the other sales we can live off it.\"</p><p>The movement toward organic food has gained momentum in the decades following the founding of Birdsfoot, something Tengeler has noticed through the sale of her organic vegetables.</p><p>\"People are much more conscious about organic food and the movement, \" she says. \"People are really wanting to know their farmers and where their food is from.\"</p>"
