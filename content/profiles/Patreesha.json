She studied criminology and has spent the last nine-year working with students with disabilities. She is married to fellow Birdsfooter Rob Carr and has a daughter.</p><p>When she gets the chance Endres spends as much time as she can in her large garden. She grows a variety of herbs, medicinals, culinaries, teas, and more.</p><p>Her commitment to living a healthy and sustainable lifestyle comes from her desire to have as small of an impact on the Earth as possible.</p><p>Endres tells a story from her college years about how members of a protest group she belonged to would pick up McDonalds on the way to protests, something that seemed incredibly hypocritical to her.</p><p>\"The commitment for me is walking my talk,\" she says. \"One thing I can do is live my life as best I can in a way I think is appropriate for the Earth and the land.\"</p><p>Endres says that while some intentional communities choose to isolate themselves from civilization, Birdsfoot embraces the broader community. She works at the local college and volunteers.</p><p>\"We made the choice to be a part of the larger community,\" she says. \"We are all involved.\"</p>"
