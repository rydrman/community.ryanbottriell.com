She says the community just came together by happenstance.</p><p>\"We just kind of all landed here at various points.\"</p><p>Fagerlund works as a nurse. She recently got married to fellow Birdsfooter Christoff Bemis.</p><p>The couple had a wedding ceremony beneath a maypole on June 7 to solidify their commitment to one another.</p><p>An interesting aspect of their relationship is the fact that they practice polyamory. This means they are able to have relationships with others while maintaining a strong relationship together.</p><p>Their decision to have a wedding ceremony may seem strange to some, but for Bemis and Fagerlund it was about solidifying their commitment to one another in front of family, friends, and the community.</p><p>\"Marriage is many things,\" says Fagerlund. \"We're committing to being with each other and being there for each other.\"</p><p>While the \"free love\" philosophy from the farm's early days is no more, the community is accepting towards the relationship.</p><p>\"Everyone really wants to be here,\" says Fagerlund. \"We care about how each other feels, and we want everyone to be happy.\"</p>"
