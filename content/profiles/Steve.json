His older son has gone off to post-secondary while his daughter Kyra attends Little River.</p><p>You can tell just by the way he talks about Little River that he is proud of his accomplishment. What started out as a school for four children has expanded to almost 40 students ranging from K-12.</p><p>Though he has a Masters degree in special education, Molnar says it was the experience teaching at similar schools during his time as an undergrad that taught him how to be an effective teacher.</p><p>\"[A Masters degree] backed it up a bit and gave me a broader view of special needs students, different settings and things like that,\" he says. \"But most of my experience has been hands on.\"</p><p>With almost 40 years of teaching under his belt, Molnar says his students come to school eager to learn.</p><p>\"All the students have individualized curriculums,\" he says. \"We're a lot more flexible in the things we can do.\"</p><p>Opened in 1999, Little River Community School offers a unique way for kids to learn. With about eight students per teacher, Molnar says he can offer something really different compared to public schools.</p><p>\"It\"s got a family kind of feel,\" he says.</p<p>The tuition for the school is just under $5,000 for one school year. Molnar says they offer financial aid for low-income families.</p<p>The students are able to make their own decisions about what they want to learn. Parents and teachers collaborate in order to develop personalized curriculums for each student, which fosters a desire to learn.</p><p>\"We're good,\" he says. \"Kids want to be here.\"</p>"
